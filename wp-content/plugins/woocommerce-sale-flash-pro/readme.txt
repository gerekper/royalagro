Contributors: woothemes
Requires at least: 3.1
Tested up to: 3.5
Stable tag: 1.2.5

Gives you global and per-product control over sale tag display and lets you show % or the amount off.

== Usage ==

To set the default Sale flash type go to WooCommerce > Settings > Catalog and look under the pricing options.

To change the format of individual product sale flashes, edit a product and look at the General tab in the product data.

Note: Sale flashes cannot be modified for grouped and variable products since it is the child products which have the sale.
