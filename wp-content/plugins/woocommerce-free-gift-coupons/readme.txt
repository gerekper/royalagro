Enables store owners to make a coupon that adds a gift product to the cart.

== Description ==

Enables store owners to make a coupon only that adds a gift item to the cart on using the coupon. For example, user buys X and gets a free Y with coupon code.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

== Coupon Configuration ==

WooCommerce Free Gift Coupons works very similarly to the other coupon types. Go to WooCommerce > Coupons and click on "Add Coupon" to create a coupon and define the coupon’s redemption code.

Under "General", an input called "Free Gifts" will appear for all supported coupon types (for combo-style coupons… ie: discount plus gift) and the "Free Gift" coupon type for giving a gift alone.

= Gift Selection =

Start typing the name of the product that you’d like to give away in the "Search for products" input until WooCommerce shows a list of potential matches. Once you see your desired product, you can select it from the list of matching products.

Free Gift coupons follow all the same Usage Restriction and Usage Limits as other Discount Types, such as by email address, minimum cart total, etc.

= Synchronising a Product =

You can sync your free gift product(s)'s quantity with a product in the cart. Go to 'Sync Quantities' section, select a product.

***Note: When a Product is synced with free gift, it is added to the required Products that must be in the cart before the coupon is valid.***

= Free Shipping for Gifts =

This setting allows the customer to not incur shipping for the gift product.  A [free shipping method](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/free-shipping/) must be enabled.

= Usage Restrictions and Limits =

Free Gift coupons follow all the same Usage Restriction and Usage Limits as other Discount Types, such as by email address, minimum cart total, etc. Read more about [Coupon Management](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/coupon-management).

The sole exception to this is if you set a product to <em>sync</em> your gift quantities to. This product will be added to the required products list.

= Publish =

When you are done configuring the Coupon, select publish and the Free Gift Coupon will now be active.

== Coupon Redemption ==

The coupon can be redeemed exactly like other coupons.  When the customer enters the appropriate code and clicks "Apply Coupon" a small message is displayed saying the code was applied and the free gift is automatically added to the cart.

== FAQ ==

= Can I give a gift if someone buys a certain number of items? For example, buy 9 'widgets' and get one free? =

Currently, no. WooCommerce doesn't yet support usage limitations by item quantity.
