"Instead of showing a CAPTCHA challenge, reCAPTCHA v3 returns a score so you "

"on interactions with your site and enables you to take an appropriate action "
"for your site. Recaptcha will rank traffic and interactions based on a score "
"of 0.0 to 1.0, with a 1.0 being a good interaction and scores closer to 0.0 "
